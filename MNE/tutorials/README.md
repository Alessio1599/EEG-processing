# Tutorials
- "10_overview.py", basic EEG/MEG pipeline for event-related analysis

I can download the tutorials also in the jupyter notebook format
- so maybe I can run them on Google Colab, since to download a dataset, is like 1 GB...Idk where the dataset was stored, I can run the tutorial....

## Comments
- Maybe it is more readable the jupyter notebook
