# Preprocessing steps

## Resampling

## Linear detrending

## Filtering

## Epoching

## Identification of bad channels via correlation method

## Artifact removal via Independent Component Analysis
Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
- EEGLab

The artifacts were identified based on the time pattern, topographical map and PSD of the estimated Independent Components.

## Interpolation of bad channels
